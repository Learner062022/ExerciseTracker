# Exercise Tracker

## Description
The Exercise Tracker App is designed to encourage users to maintain a healthy lifestyle by tracking their daily exercise activities. Aiming for a customizable average of exercise per day (default is 30 minutes), the app allows users to log their exercise minutes, calculates their daily average, and provides visual feedback to keep them motivated. With customizable settings and a user-friendly interface, this app is an essential tool for anyone looking to improve their physical activity levels.

- **Progress Overview:** Shows total hours exercised and hours expected against the target, as well as the daily avarage and minutes needed to reach the daily average goal.
